the analysis is divided into 2 parts.


1. Random optimization algotithms, tunning and impilentations:
    - File : base,ipynb
    : this file contains methods and defined to optimize the algorithms and save the data in  runner_out folder.
    : this data is further used to create model summaries which is written in the agg_tables folder.
    : this module also generates best models and create loss as well as learning curves which are further savein the figure folder
    
2. Neural network weight optimization:
    - File base_NN_regressor
    : this is the module which processes and creates data used for the NN optimization.
    : defines functions which are further used for optimization of the neural network wegihts for the 4 algorithms
    : it also create the learning curves as the task 1 and save the same in the figure folder.
